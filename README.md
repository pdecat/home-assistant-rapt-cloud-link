# RAPT Cloud Integration for Home Assistant

![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-blue.svg)

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that connects to [RAPT Cloud](https://app.rapt.io) and allows you to monitor and control your BrewZilla, RAPT Pill, or other RAPT-compatible brewing devices.

## Features

- Cloud polling for real-time updates from your devices.
- Supports multiple device types including:
  - BrewZilla (temperature, heating, pump, etc.)
  - RAPT Pill (gravity, temperature, battery)
  - Bonded devices (RAPT Bluethooth Thermometer)
- Displays sensor values such as:
  - Temperature
  - Specific Gravity
  - Battery
  - Target Temperature
  - Heating State
  - Pump State
  - BrewZilla Profile and Profile Step: the name of the profile a BrewZilla is
    running and of its active step, `unknown` when no profile session is
    active. The step sensor carries the step number and count, control and end
    types, duration (seconds, `Duration` steps only), target temperature, start
    time and the next step's name as attributes.
  - BrewZilla Profile Step End: when the active step's duration runs out, for
    `Duration` steps counted from their start. The start is read from the
    BrewZilla's telemetry once per step, so it survives a restart.
  - BrewZilla Profile Session (binary): on while a profile session runs.
  - BrewZilla At Target Temperature (binary): on while the temperature the
    BrewZilla regulates on (its bonded probe, unless set to use its internal
    sensor) is within its heating hysteresis of the target.
  - Pill Profile, Profile Step and Profile Session: the same profile entities as
    the BrewZilla's, for a Pill running a fermentation profile. The Profile
    sensor of either also carries the session's estimated end, original and
    final gravity, and the profile's alert texts as attributes.
  - Pill Gravity Velocity, in points per day (one point is 0.001 SG), and Last
    Activity, when the Pill last reported. The Pill Connection sensor now reads
    `unknown` rather than `Disconnected`, as the API does not report it for Pills.
- Control entities:
  - Heating switch
  - Pump switch
  - Heating Utilization
  - Pump Utilization
  - Target Temperature

## Installation (via HACS)

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed in your Home Assistant instance.
2. Go to **HACS > Integrations**.
3. Click the three dots in the top right and choose **Custom Repositories**.
4. Add this repository: https://github.com/berra200/home-assistant-rapt-cloud and choose **Integration** as category.
5. Find `RAPT Cloud` in the HACS list and install it.
6. Restart Home Assistant.
7. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services** and click **Add Integration**.
8. Search for `RAPT Cloud` and follow the configuration flow.

## Configuration

- You need an **API key** from RAPT Cloud (not just a password) to authenticate.
- The integration automatically discovers your devices linked to your account.

## Upcoming Features

- Additional device types and enhanced sensor/control options.
- Improved error handling and stability.

## Tips & Notes

- The integration polls your devices periodically to provide real-time updates.
- Make sure your API key has the correct permissions in RAPT Cloud.
- Feedback and contributions are welcome via GitHub issues and pull requests.
