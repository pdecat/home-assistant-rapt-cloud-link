# RAPT Cloud Integration for Home Assistant

![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-blue.svg)

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that connects to [RAPT Cloud](https://app.rapt.io) and allows you to monitor and control your BrewZilla, RAPT Pill, or other RAPT-compatible brewing devices.

## Features

- Cloud polling for real-time updates from your devices.
- Supports multiple device types including:
  - BrewZilla (temperature, heating, pump, etc.)
  - RAPT Pill (gravity, temperature, battery)
  - Bonded devices (RAPT Bluethooth Thermometer)
- Displays sensor values such as:
  - Temperature
  - Specific Gravity
  - Battery
  - Target Temperature
  - Heating State
  - Pump State
  - BrewZilla Profile and Profile Step: the name of the profile a BrewZilla is
    running and of its active step, `unknown` when no profile session is
    active. The step sensor carries the step number and count, control and end
    types, duration (seconds, `Duration` steps only), target temperature and
    the next step's name as attributes.
- Control entities:
  - Heating switch
  - Pump switch
  - Heating Utilization
  - Pump Utilization
  - Target Temperature
